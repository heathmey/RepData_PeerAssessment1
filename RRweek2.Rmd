```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Setup the dataset and R for the analysis
 
First we want to load the appropriate packages to clean the data and generate the plots
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(lattice)
```

Then we want to read the data in from the working directory

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Next we want to do some processing of the dataset to get a consistent table
```{r}
activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))
activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
```

Finally, before we start the analysis, we want to remove null (NA) values from the data set

```{r}
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
```


## Task #1
Calculate the number of steps walked each day (mean & median) & create a histogram

First we want to create a table where we sum the values daily:
```{r}
sumTable <- aggregate(activity$steps ~ activity$date, FUN=sum, )
colnames(sumTable)<- c("Date", "Steps")
```

We can use this table to create a histogram of the data
```{r}
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day")
```

We can also use this table to calculate the mean steps per day
```{r}
as.integer(mean(sumTable$Steps))
```

And, to calculate the median steps per day
```{r}
as.integer(median(sumTable$Steps))
```

## Task #2
Now we want to look at the daily activity pattern for the entire dataset.

We begin by creating a table of averages for 5 minutes intervals throughout the day.
```{r}
intervalTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
```

Then we can plot this data in a line plot to get an idea of the daily pattern.
```{r}
p <- ggplot(intervalTable, aes(x=interval, y=Avg), xlab = "Interval", ylab="Average Number of Steps")
p + geom_line()+xlab("Interval")+ylab("Average Number of Steps")+ggtitle("Average Steps per Interval")
```

We can also determine which interval has the maximum number of steps on average.
```{r}
maxSteps <- max(intervalTable$Avg)
intervalTable[intervalTable$Avg==maxSteps,1]
```

##Task #3 
This task looks at imputing the missing values with a value of our choice. For this I chose to use the average steps for the day at the missing given interval

First we look at the number of null (NA) values in the original dataset:
```{r}
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
```

Next we create a dataset that includes just the NA values from the original data.
```{r}
NAdata<- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]
```

Next we want to determine the average number of steps on a day during an interval
```{r}
avgTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval, day), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
```

Then we merge the data from above and the NA table we created
```{r}
newdata<-merge(NAdata, avgTable, by=c("interval", "day"))
```
We need to Reorder the new data in the same format as clean data set
```{r}
newdata2<- newdata[,c(6,4,1,2,5)]
colnames(newdata2)<- c("steps", "date", "interval", "day", "DateTime")
```

Then, we merge the imputed data into the clean dataset that we were just using in tasks 1 & 2:
```{r}
AllData <- rbind(clean, newdata2)
```

Now we can analyze this new dataset and compare it to the answers in task 1

We start by creating the sum of steps per date to compare with step 1
```{r}
sumTable2 <- aggregate(AllData$steps ~ AllData$date, FUN=sum, )
colnames(sumTable2)<- c("Date", "Steps")
```

Next we can calculate the mean of the steps in the new data table:
```{r}
as.integer(mean(sumTable2$Steps))
```

Lastly we can create a histogram to look at the difference between the steps in the table without NA values and this new table with the NA values added in.
```{r}
hist(sumTable2$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Blue")
hist(sumTable$Steps, breaks=5, xlab="Steps", main = "Total Steps per Day with NAs Fixed", col="Purple", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed Data", "Non-NA Data"), fill=c("blue", "purple") )
```

##Task #4
Lastly, we want to compare the number of steps taken on the weekend days vs. week days

We need to create new category based on the days of the week
```{r}
AllData$DayCategory <- ifelse(AllData$day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
```

Next we want to look at the average steps taken on the weekend days versus the weekdays. To do this we need to separate the table into weekdays and weekends.
```{r}
intervalTable2 <- ddply(AllData, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))
```


Then we want to plot the data in a panel plot with the intervals on the x axis and then number of steps on the y axis. The two panels are for weekends and weekday averages.
```{r}
xyplot(Avg~interval|DayCategory, data=intervalTable2, type="l",  layout = c(1,2),
       main="Average Steps per Interval", 
       ylab="Average Number of Steps", xlab="Interval")
```
